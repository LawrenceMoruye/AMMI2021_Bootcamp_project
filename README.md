## Basic Note (Model Approach)

Based on the visualizations on checking features relationship we were able to discovered some features with high correlation with the target.

This features contains some marginal point which separate the two classes. Hence we use this point has threshold (generated from train data) to predict the correct label.

Also this features are combined using Voteclassifier to find the optimal prediction.
